### About Me :
I am on my last steps to get my diploma in Polytechnics Engineering School of Sousse in Computer Engineering with different development skills

Hard-work and determination are key aspects in defining who I am. I discovered this during school projects period when you are compelled to complete around 10 projects before the dead-line while meeting the requirements.

From this experience, I realized that the only limit to my success is myself. I carry this ideology with me, and I shall continue for the rest of my life. My long-term goal is to develop a good strong career as an expert in developing Artificial Intelligence.

I am so confident that my skills-set which includes competitive edge, attention to detail, passion and ambition. It will largely contribute in achieving my career goals.

"Keep away from those who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you believe that you too can become great." ___ Mark TWAIN
